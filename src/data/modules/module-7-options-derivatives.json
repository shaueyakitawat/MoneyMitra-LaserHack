        "original": "Derivative = Financial instrument whose value derives from underlying asset (stock, index, commodity). Types: Futures (obligation to buy/sell), Options (right but not obligation). Used for: (1) Hedging (risk protection), (2) Speculation (leverage), (3) Arbitrage (risk-free profit). Derivatives magnify gains AND losses (leverage). Lot size: Nifty = 25, Bank Nifty = 15. Expiry: Last Thursday of month. Physical vs Cash settlement. High risk - only for experienced investors with risk capital.",

(1) Protection: Like insurance for your stocks, (2) Betting: Predict market direction with small money (leverage), (3) Income: Sell options to collect premium. Warning: Derivatives are powerful but dangerous - can lose more than invested. Beginners should avoid or start with very small amounts. Not for emergency or essential money.",
