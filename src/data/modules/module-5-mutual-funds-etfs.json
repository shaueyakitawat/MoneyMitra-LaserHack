NAV (Net Asset Value) = Total portfolio value / Number of units. Types: Equity funds (stocks), Debt funds (bonds), Hybrid funds (mix). Open-ended funds allow daily buy/sell, closed-ended have fixed tenure. SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) enables disciplined monthly investing.",
        "simplified": "Mutual fund is like a basket where many investors put their money together. Expert fund manager then invests this big pool in many different stocks/bonds. You buy units of the fund. If fund's investments grow, your unit value (NAV) increases. Types: Equity funds (higher risk, higher return), Debt funds (lower risk, stable return), Hybrid (balanced). You can invest monthly small amounts through SIP instead of big lumpsum.",
