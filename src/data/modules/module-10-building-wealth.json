At 12%, doubles in 6 years. Starting early is more important than amount. 25-year-old investing ₹5,000/month beats 35-year-old investing ₹15,000/month. Time is your biggest asset.

Your friend starts at 35, invests same ₹5,000/month till 60 (invested ₹15L total). At 60, he has ₹2.4 Cr. You invested LESS but earned MORE - that's power of starting early.
