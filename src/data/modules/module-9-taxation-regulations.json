First ₹1.25L tax-free, remaining ₹0.75L taxed at 12.5% = ₹9,375 tax. If you sold in 10 months (short-term), entire ₹2L taxed at 20% = ₹40,000 tax. Big difference! Lesson: Hold >1 year when possible.

Strategy: Sell losers in year with big gains to neutralize tax. Can buyback same stock immediately (no wash-sale rule in India). Use ₹1.25L LTCG exemption optimally - book gains annually to use exemption. Dividend income taxable at slab rate - consider growth option over dividend option in MFs. Gift to spouse/children to utilize their lower tax bracket (clubbing provisions apply for minors). Offset gains across asset classes strategically. Maintain detailed records. Tax filing by 31st July mandatory for capital gains.",
        "simplified": "Tax-loss harvesting = Smart way to reduce tax. Example: You made ₹3L profit on Stock A (will pay tax). Stock B is showing ₹1L loss (on paper). Sell Stock B before March 31 - your taxable profit becomes ₹2L instead of ₹3L. You can buyback Stock B immediately next day if you still like it (allowed in India). Another trick: Every year, book some profits to use ₹1.25L tax-free limit. If you don't sell anything, you waste this exemption. Example: Stocks worth ₹10L grown to ₹12L. Sell ₹1.25L profit worth stocks before March, buy back immediately. Now your cost base increased (saves future tax). Smart investors do this annually. Also: Mutual funds - choose Growth option, not Dividend (dividends taxed every year, growth taxed only when you sell).",
