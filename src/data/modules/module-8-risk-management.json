(5) Interest rate risk - bond prices fall when rates rise. (6) Inflation risk - purchasing power erosion. (7) Currency risk - forex fluctuations. (8) Political/Regulatory risk - government policy changes. Understand risk-return tradeoff: Higher return requires accepting higher risk. Risk cannot be eliminated, only managed.",

(4) Inflation risk: Your money's buying power decreases - ₹100 today worth ₹70 in 10 years. (5) Interest rate risk: When RBI increases rates, bond values fall. Key rule: Want higher returns? Must accept higher risk. No high return without risk - anyone promising that is lying.",

(4) Selling winners in 6 months (20% tax) instead of holding 1+ year (12.5% tax). Plan taxes. (5) Putting all money in one or two stocks - if they fail, you're finished. (6) Acting on WhatsApp tips - by time tip reaches you, smart money has already exited. (7) Starting to invest at 35 instead of 25 - you lose 10 years of compounding (massive difference).
