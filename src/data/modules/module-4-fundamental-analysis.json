        "original": "Three key financial statements: Balance Sheet shows assets, liabilities, equity at a point in time. Profit & Loss (P&L) shows revenue, expenses, profit over period. Cash Flow Statement tracks actual cash inflows/outflows. Together they reveal company's financial health. Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Revenue - Expenses = Net Profit. Operating, Investing, Financing cash flows must be analyzed.",
        "simplified": "Balance Sheet = What company owns (assets) and owes (liabilities) on specific date. P&L = How much company earned (revenue) and spent (expenses) over time period. Cash Flow = Actual cash coming in and going out. Profit doesn't always mean cash in hand. A company can show profit but have no cash (accounting vs reality).",
        "hindi": "बैलेंस शीट = कंपनी के पास क्या है (संपत्ति) और क्या उधार है (देनदारियां) किसी तारीख पर। P&L = कंपनी ने कितना कमाया (रेवेन्यू) और खर्च किया (खर्चे) समय अवधि में। कैश फ्लो = असली नकदी जो आ रही और जा रही है। प्रॉफिट का मतलब हमेशा कैश नहीं (अकाउंटिंग बनाम हकीकत)।"

Liquidity: Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities, measures ability to pay short-term obligations.",
        "simplified": "PE ratio tells if stock is expensive or cheap compared to earnings. Low PE might mean undervalued (or company has problems). High PE might mean overvalued (or high growth expected). ROE shows how efficiently company uses shareholder money - higher is better. Debt-to-Equity shows how much company relies on loans - too high is risky. Current ratio shows if company can pay bills coming due soon.",
        "hindi": "PE रेशियो बताता है कि स्टॉक महंगा है या सस्ता अर्निंग्स के मुकाबले। कम PE मतलब अंडरवैल्यूड हो सकता है (या कंपनी की प्रॉब्लम्स)। ज्यादा PE मतलब ओवरवैल्यूड हो सकता है (या हाई ग्रोथ expected)। ROE दिखाता है कंपनी शेयरहोल्डर के पैसे का कितनी कुशलता से इस्तेमाल करती है - ज्यादा बेहतर। डेट-टू-इक्विटी दिखाता है कंपनी कितना लोन पर निर्भर है - बहुत ज्यादा risky।"

        "original": "Discounted Cash Flow (DCF): Project future cash flows and discount to present value using WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital).

Margin of safety: Buy only if market price significantly below intrinsic value. Different methods give different values - use multiple approaches.",
        "simplified": "Intrinsic value = What stock is actually worth based on company's ability to generate cash. DCF method: Estimate how much cash company will generate in future, then calculate what that's worth today. PE method: Multiply expected earnings by fair PE ratio.

        "hindi": "इंट्रिंसिक वैल्यू = स्टॉक की असली कीमत जो कंपनी की कैश जेनरेट करने की क्षमता पर आधारित है। DCF मेथड: अनुमान लगाएं कंपनी भविष्य में कितना कैश बनाएगी, फिर calculate करें वो आज कितना worth है। PE मेथड: expected अर्निंग्स को फेयर PE से multiply करें। अगर इंट्रिंसिक वैल्यू ₹500 है लेकिन मार्केट प्राइस ₹350 है, तो स्टॉक undervalued हो सकता है।"

Types: Brand moat (Coca-Cola, Apple), Network effects (Facebook, PayTM), Cost advantages (Walmart, Amazon), Switching costs (SAP, Microsoft), Intangible assets (patents, licenses). Wide moat companies can maintain high returns on capital. Analyze if advantage is durable (10+ years) or temporary. Moats erode over time - continuous assessment needed.",
        "simplified": "Moat = Protection that keeps competitors away, like a castle's moat keeps enemies out. Brand moat: People prefer your brand (iPhone users rarely switch to Android). Network moat: More users make product more valuable (WhatsApp). Cost moat: You can produce cheaper than others. Switching cost moat: Too painful for customers to switch (imagine changing all your bank accounts). Companies with strong moats can charge higher prices and earn more profit for many years.",
        "hindi": "Moat = सुरक्षा जो प्रतिस्पर्धियों को दूर रखती है, जैसे किले की खाई दुश्मनों को दूर रखती है। ब्रांड moat: लोग आपके ब्रांड को prefer करते हैं। नेटवर्क moat: ज्यादा यूज़र्स प्रोडक्ट को ज्यादा valuable बनाते हैं (WhatsApp)। कॉस्ट moat: आप दूसरों से सस्ता produce कर सकते हैं। स्विचिंग कॉस्ट moat: ग्राहकों के लिए switch करना बहुत painful। मजबूत moats वाली कंपनियां ज्यादा कीमत charge कर सकती हैं।"
