        "simplified": "Asset allocation means deciding how much money goes into stocks, bonds, gold, real estate etc. This decision is MORE important than which specific stocks you pick. Young investors can be aggressive (80% stocks, 20% bonds) because they have time to recover from losses. Older investors near retirement should be conservative (40% stocks, 60% bonds) to protect capital. Don't put all eggs in one basket - spread across different assets. When one goes down, others may go up.",
